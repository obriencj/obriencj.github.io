My name is Christopher O'Brien, but I typically go by the monicker
'siege.' The story behind this nickname is significantly less
interesting than you might imagine.

I am the proud father of a beautiful daughter named Zoe. When she was
little she loved riding her bike and playing Minecraft. Now she is
much taller and off on her own.

I work for [Red Hat] in the role of a Release Engineer, wherein I get
to apply the saner aspects of my programming skills to the domain of
building and releasing product software.

## Hobbies

[![Oh god what have I done][DSC00106]{.image-process-inline .right}][DSC00106]
I enjoy riding both motorcycles and bicycles. I am a hobbyist
programmer when I feel like being a professional software engineer
hasn't sucked the joy out of it. I like to sculpt and paint, but I
generally only have a few good ideas before I have to pack those
mediums away for another year. I enjoy people-watching and trying to
figure out what's going on in groups from across a room.

I work at ridiculous projects in the wee hours of the night.
Frequently things that nobody would (nor should) actually use.
However, I do not view this time as wasted. These mad hacks are a
creative exercise, and I find that my re-inventions can provide
excellent insight into otherwise inobvious situations.
