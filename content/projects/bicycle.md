# Current Bikes

I currently own three bicycles. They are very distinct beasts from
one-another.


## Kona Rove - Gravel and Greenway

The [Rove] is my go-to and default bike. I take the rove on city
streets, greenways, and gravel rail-trails. I've had in on a number of
single-track rides, before I got a proper mountain bike, and it never
once complained.

It was on the rove that I spent [one of the best years of my
life][bikewife] with my partner at the time.

I've updated a number of components on the rove. It rides on a 700c
wheelset, featuring a [DT Swiss rear] and [Velocity Aileron front],
with a [Son generator hub]. I prefer the [American Classic Kimberlite
tires][kimberlite] due to the fact that I'm almost always on
hard-packed clean gravel or paved greenways. The drivetrain was
upgraded to a 1x11 SRAM configuration, mixing their [Force
derailleur], [Rival crank], and [Apex controls]. I perch on a [Brooks
C17 saddle]. The handlebars are [RedShift's Kitchen Sink][kitchen] on
their [Shock-Stop] stem.

I bought the rove directly from [Oak City Cycling] in November of 2022.

## Kona Big Honzo - Trails and Downhill

The [Big Honzo] is my goto for offroading. I have only recently (as of
December 2023) begun taking it out and about on proper trails. I'm
still nervous, but there's a lot of fun to be had bouncing around on
the dirt.

I bought the big honzo from [Jenson] in October of 2023.

## Kona Ute - Ridiculous

The kona ute is the result of a post-breakup break-down that led me
feeling overly spontaneous. I had been dwelling on the idea of a cargo
bike and misty-eyed dreams of picnic rides with a cooler and blanket
rolls and folding chairs. I could easily accommodate all of those
accoutrements.

The problem is that I doubt I'll ever feel like taking such a picnic
on my own. And the bike is so long that I cannot transport it to a
trailhead using my car's bike rack. I will be attempting to clean it
up and get it into a usable state for grocery rides in the summer.

I bought the ute from a fellow in Lititz, PA in December of 2023.
