Herein lies a breakdown of the work I've been scoping out for the
VT500FT that I bought on craigslist, which I am affectionately calling
"Uggo". This list could vary wildly as new problems are diagnosed, or
be re-arranged as issues or parts appear. It's just what I've been able
to think of so far.

## Far-off Future

Once the bike is running clean and controls are operating safely, I'll
consider getting the fenders, and the plastic trim cleaned, smoothed,
and repainted a nice glossy black. The tank I'll get done in a nice
glossy red.

There are some options for aftermarket shocks and exhausts, it might
be worth looking into.

It could also be neat to ditch the air box and go with pod-style
filters. This would mean re-jetting the carbs, and then taking it to a
shop to have them put it on a dyno and try to get the jetting
correct. Worth it? Maybe.

Perhaps minimize the battery and relocate the rectifier to go for a
minimalistic feel for the bike's center?

Custom fiberglass replacement for seat plastics. Keep the fender
as-is.

Better brake and shift levers that aren't at such awkward heights.

Replacement key set (ignition, tank, helmet lock, toolbox)
