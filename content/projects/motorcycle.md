I currently own three motorcycles. I most frequently ride a fantastic
piece of Japanese machinery, the Suzuki TU250x. I also have a
beater/project bike, a 1984 Honda VT500FT. It's in rough condition,
but it was inexpensive and I think it will be a lot of fun to fix. The
third bike is a wonderful Suzuki GT250 from 1976, a two-stroke twin
that is hella fun to ride.


## 2013 Suzuki TU250x, Tux

Fuel injected, SOHC, air-cooled -- 249cc of pure joy.  Mine came from
[Team Powersports in Raleigh][tps]. I've made a few modifications so
far, but apart from the possibility of a custom seat someday I think
I'm about done changing her up.

* removed stickers
* added tank knee pads
* intake snorkel removed
* second-hand, black flyscreen from Dart
* [Kyle Racing bar-end weights](http://www.shop.kyleusa.com/product.sc?productId=629&categoryId=58) and generic bar-end mirrors
* [OEM fork gaiters](http://japan.webike.net/products/1566192.html)
* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVS6H2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001AVS6H2&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=K6LGILBZWIVUP2RE">16T Front Sprocket</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001AVS6H2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
* Shinko 712 tires <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD8W68/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001CD8W68&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=XQGQJPYZMHPVUZFW">Front - 100/90-18</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001CD8W68" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005242JDA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005242JDA&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=DVM3KYOM7AXL5AKS">Rear - 120/90-18</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005242JDA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (one size up for both)
* [PAIR valve] removed
* [Kickstart] added (from the Japanese ST250 E-Type)
* [RSY Beauty] exhaust (now painted black)
* Power Commander V

I would love to pick up the classic-styled front and rear fender from
Japan and to get the whole bike painted a nice deep Oxblood and cream
two-tone. Maybe that can be a five-year present?

I'm interested in some of the air and battery relocation jobs I've
seen others do. I admire the minimalist look that results.

A [Frankentux]({filename}/projects/motorcycle/frankentux.md) might be a fun idea, too.

## 1984 Honda VT500FT, Uggo

I snagged the [Uggo] in December of 2014 after she caught my eye on
craigslist. She's as ugly as the nickname implies, but there's a
certain charm that I find very appealing. She needs so much work, but
that's all of the fun really.

500cc, liquid cooled, v-twin, shaft-driven. Plastic bits that scream
"look at me, I'm from the 80s" and some seriously worn components. I
think she wants to become a cafe bike or perhaps a flat tracker. We
shall have to see.

She came to me as a [hot mess], but now she's [hauling ass].

## 1976 Suzuki GT250, Gertie Peanut

A wonderful two stroke twin from the era of the best bikes, I am very
lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to snag this
bike.

## 1994 Tomos Targa

This is actually Zoe's bike, not mine. For her birthday in 2015 I
bought her a 49cc two-stroke moped. It needed some love, but was
functional from day one. Zoe loves it, but she's only allowed to take
it on back roads until she's older. So far she claims to have gotten
it up to 31 mph, an impressive feat!
