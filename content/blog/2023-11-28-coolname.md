<!-- summary -->

Over Thanksgiving break I decided to brush up on my extremely outdated
CSS and JavaScript knowledge. It turns out a lot has changed over the
past 20 years. What hasn't changed is my lack of any sense of style.

If I were to allow the fear of creating an eyesore hinder me, I'd
never get started with anything. So after casting concerns of user
experience to the wind I drafted up a simple idea for a web service
that could make use of server and client side interactions.  Behold,
[flask-coolname], a basic [flask] application that does little more
than provide [coolname] slugs.

It's been interesting to try and adopt some of the async javascript
ideas. It's a shame that the python variation on async is such a pain
to use, because the javascript implementation is pretty nice to work
with. The event loop is running implicitly, and handlers for element
actions can be either normal or async.

I think the things that were the most fascinating to me from a CSS
perspective were the addition of [mask], [transform], and
[animation]. There are so many simple yet pleasant enhancements just
from having some slight fading happen here and there. Also I am in
love with the idea of transitioning an element's height to zero and
then removing it, that's such a great way to animate a list changing
its content.

I do have a bunch of redundancies in my CSS. I'll need to slowly prune
directives until I get it minimalized a bit. There are some cases
where I really think it would be easier to just do it the old way and
(mis)use a table to do layout, but I'll keep fighting with flex and
auto margins a while longer.

I bundled up a container image which is hosted on [ghcr.io], built via
[CI] on the master branch. I'm using this to host a demo copy of the
application, which you can take a look at here -

I'd like to create a truly ridiculous version of this app some day. I
would use OAuth and accounts with credits. The credits would be used
to buy word packs, save slots, and slug rolls. Users could then try to
accumulate interesting phrases, or auction them off for credits! I'd
have statistics generated to see what words were most liked. Utter
nonsense and useless, but I could get some practice on how to properly
do account management and oauth. I'd also be fighting to make sure
that I could prevent cheating, so a lot more would be happening
app-side rather than client-side. It seems interesting to develop,
even if the end result is dumb. It would give me a reason to work with
helm charts and pods as well, since this would obviously be a
multi-container application.
