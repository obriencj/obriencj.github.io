I've been wanting a new exhaust for [Tux] for a while now. The factory
muffler is enormous, heavy, tends towards rust at the end, and is
almost silent.

I'd tried out the inexpensive slip-on [Mini-Norton] from
[Dime City Cycles], but it was too flipping loud (distractingly so
while moving) and it required a full stack of adapters (and tape!)  to
make it fit Tux's exhaust pipe. It also required me to craft a bar to
support it from the frame, which left it somewhat unstable, putting
more force than I'd really wanted on the exhaust header screws. I ran
with it for a day, but had to retire it due to the sheer ear-wrecking
volume.

Some time later I happened to run across photos of the [RSY Beauty].
It's designed specifically for the TU250x, and rated at a sensible
89dB. Promising!

I ordered it from [Web!ke] as an early Christmas present for myself,
and was surprised to discover upon its arrival that it was actually a
full exhaust system, not just the muffler. The exhaust header is
stainless steel to match the muffler. It has some built-in baffling
just after the port for the lambda probe. The muffler itself has only
a minor cage baffle, and is very lightweight. It has a tab that fits
with the existing mounting bracket perfectly. It's louder than the
original muffler (which was ridiculously quiet), but not
ear-bleedingly so like the Mini-Norton was. It has an overall pleasant
tone, nothing too tinny or sputtering. It does suffer from an
occasional roll-off pop, but that isn't a huge deal.

I recorded a short video of my kicking Tux over so people could get a
feeling for how she sounds now.

I'm considering wrapping the pipe in black, since it seems to shed a
lot more heat than the original pipe had done. It went blue-gold in
less than a day! I'll have to think about it.

[edit]: fixed grammar in a few places.
