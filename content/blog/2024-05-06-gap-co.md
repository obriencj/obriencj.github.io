<!-- summary -->

Early on this year I had decided to throw myself into a seven day ride
from Pittsburgh, PA to Washington, DC. 330 miles all on my lonesome,
just me and the bike and whatever I brought on it. As time passed and
the trip date drew ever closer I started to panic about my
preparedness levels. Here is the chronicle of those events.

Panic is setting in. I need to redo the wiring on the Rove. I need to
get the wheels checked to make sure my spokes and rims are in good
tune. I need to re-align my brake calipers a bit. I've made a list of
what I'm packing, but I haven't actually tried to make it fit in the
panniers yet.

I've got a week off of work, and initial planning had put most of the
tasks I needed done in this week or after the trip. Of course that
didn't last, and now work is slipping and landing right when I'll be
gone, which means I need to arrange for coverage.

I've been doing some long rides to get my body back up to spec, but
I'm still not back to my fitness levels from the end of 2023. February
really set me back.


## Later that Evening

I spent a bit of time working to re-route the wiring so it wasn't
relying on so much electrician tape. In so doing, I managed to split
the shift cable housing, which was quite brittle by the rear
derailleur. In a panic I tried to find a newer cable and housing, but
had nothing suitable in my spares bin.

Oak City should have some, I'll need to visit them tomorrow so I can
get my shifting reconnected tomorrow.

Was stressed all morning.  I had spent a little more time packing, but
I think I'm over doing it and trying to bring too much stuff.

Called Oak City when they opened, and of course they had what I
needed. Picked it up and had lunch downtown. It was a fight, but I
replaced the cabling, got the wiring patched in, and all seems well
again.


# 2024-04-24, 2 Days Prior

Got the pannier mount locations dialed in, and I added some tape as
padding to keep it from rattling around in an annoying manner. I put
my snacks bag back on the handlebars.

Printed out a copy of train tickets and itinerary. Created the daily
routes on Strava and sync'd them to my Garmin.


# 2024-04-25, 1 Day Prior

Frantically trying to get enough work done so people can cover for me
while I'm on PTO.

Everything is on chargers. Need to double check that I have the
relevant cables along with me.

I need to re-pack. I'm going to take a short ride around the local
loop here fully loaded to validate that everything is stable and feels
alright.

I'll need to leave the house by 8am tomorrow morning to make my train.


# 2024-04-26, Train Ride from Raleigh

Parked downtown, loaded bags on bike and pedaled the two blocks to the
station. Was on the platform as the train pulled up. Detached my bags,
handed my bike over to a really nice guy who loaded it up. There was
some delay as they needed to clean my room, so I ended up in the
dining car chatting with a fellow who was a frequent rider.

The train status page currently says I should be arriving in DC thirty
minutes early.


## Rocky Mount

Rolled into Rocky Mount at 10:20am. We're supposed to have left at
10:23am, but it's currently 10:36am. Anxiety climbing.

Train dpearted late, at 10:40am. Status page still thinks we'll be
early to DC. We're just creeping slowly along, likely waiting for a
freight train to get off of a shared segment.


## Petersburg

Rolled into Petersburg at 12:26pm. Rolled back out at 12:28pm, nice! I
wish all the stops were this rapid. Maybe we can get some time back
after all.


## Richmond

Rolled into Richmond at 1:00pm. Rolled back out at 1:10, which was
less late than it was supposed to be, so that's good!


## Alexandria

Rolled into Alexandria at 2:50pm. Next stop is mine, so I'm packing up
now so I can be ready to leap off the train and transfer over to the
next one.


## Washington, DC

What a nightmare. I heard the calls for "next stop" and everything
seemed like I'd have almost an hour of time to get on my next
train. Then we came to a stop, well short of the station. The
conductor announced something over the intercoms about "waiting on
commuter traffic." For thirty minutes we sat still! Then finally we
creaked our way forward, went underground, and arrived at the station.
It was 3:35! I grabbed my bike from the luggage car and hauled ass up
to the station. I waited in line at the ticket counter as minutes
passed and then finally got the check tag for my bike. I hauled ass to
platform D, track 15, alllll the way to the end for the baggage car
there, unloaded the bike, handed it up to the conductor, then ran
inside with my bags. I sat down at 3:56. The train rolled out on time,
4:05.

I'm safely on the way to Pittsburgh. I don't care if there are stops
along the way, or if we are delayed, just so long as we get there. The
current estimate is 11:50pm. The hotel is expecting me to check in
after midnight already. It's about a 1 mile ride, estimated at 10
minutes.
