<!-- summary -->

I decided to throw myself into a seven day ride from Pittsburgh, PA to
Washington, DC.

Panic is setting in. I need to redo the wiring on the Rove. I need to
get the wheels checked to make sure my spokes and rims are in good
tune. I need to re-align my brake calipers a bit. I've made a list of
what I'm packing, but I haven't actually tried to make it fit in the
panniers yet.

I've got a week off of work, and initial planning had put most of the
tasks I needed done in this week or after the trip. Of course that
didn't last, and now work is slipping and landing right when I'll be
gone, which means I need to arrange for coverage.

I've been doing some long rides to get my body back up to spec, but
I'm still not back to my fitness levels from the end of 2023. February
really set me back.
