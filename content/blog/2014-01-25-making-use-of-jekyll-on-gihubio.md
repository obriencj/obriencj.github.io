I've finally got a setup beyond a quick [multimarkdown]-generated page
in `~/public_html` and have moved into the space age with [Jekyll] on
[github.io]. I'm swimming in the posibilities.

<!-- more -->

Is this more convenient or better than the [Tumblr] I'd been
maintaining?  I'm not sure. I know these pages get to take advantage
of the CDN. That's a bonus. I also know that I have direct access to
the full history and content of all of my posts immediately -- also a
bonus.

But I am not very happy with the theming right now. I've had to make a
number of changes to what should have been a functioning theme (but
which wasn't). Do I want to get invested in layout design as part of
this? Not really, no. But it may be worth the effort.

Things to consider on a lazy and cold Sunday.
