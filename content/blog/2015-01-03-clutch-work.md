<!-- summary -->
I got a bit more work done on Uggo, this past Friday. It was more of a
struggle than it really ought to be, getting myself moving and
collected enough to work on anything. I think that I may be suffering
from a bit of seasonal depression. Either that or the monumental,
overwhelming dread of returning to work is getting to me. Whatever it
is, I eventually conquered it enough to drag my tools out to the bike
and get my hands dirty.

I started off by draining the oil. It came out thick and grey. This
has me a little worried, but not terribly -- I'd mentioned before that
I had to stuff rags into the intakes, but it's been miserable and
rainy for a while, and condensation has been a real issue. I'll keep
an eye on this after the bike is back together again.

The oil filter had a bunch of big dents in it. It's in an awkward
place, and I had to use a strap wrench and my breaker bar to get it
turning, but off it did eventually come.

I then replaced the drain plug, and placed a block of wood and my jack
under the engine. I jacked it up enough that the rear wheel was on the
ground and then I removed the sub-frame assembly from the right-side
of the engine. A pleasant change from the Suzuki, all the bolts save
one were identical, and all were 6mm alan heads. One of the bolts was
slightly damaged, but I was able to get it to turn out after a bit of
a fight.

I wrestled away the side cover, and took a good look around the inside
of the clutch side of the case. No obvious bits of metal or anything,
so that's a bonus. The gasket material is going to be a real bastard
to get off, as usual. I've got a replacement gasket ready to go, once
I can get this one cleaned off.

I removed the press-plate from the clutch assembly, and the four
springs. I had to do some gymnastics, standing on the back brake and
yanking on the breaker bar to get the 24mm nut off of the assembly so
I could pull it to replace the friction plates.

Once I did get them out, the old friction plates were as I'd
expected. Three of the plates had been work completely smooth on both
sides. The others were nearly there, but I could still make out a tiny
indentation between the friction material pads on them. No wonder it
slipped!

I installed the new plates and re-assembled the stack and assembly,
and performed more gymnastics to get it back attached to the
countershaft. This is a very awkward arrangement -- I much prefer the
Suzuki for clutch plate maintenance -- just remove the five bolts over
the springs, and you can slide the pressure plate right off and remove
the plates! Oh well, it's not like this is a particularly frequent
check.
