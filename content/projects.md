[TOC]

I work on a number of "mad scientist" projects whenever the fancy
strikes me. I've probably used that idiom incorrectly. I re-invent
things because it's fun. I also find that it's a great way to
viscerally learn why certain approaches are taken; running into the
pitfalls and mistakes on your own then crawling your way back out of
the mess. It gives an excellent perspective.


# Motorcycle Projects

I have a few fantastic little motorcycles, let me tell you all about them!

* [Motorcycle Project Page]({filename}/projects/motorcycle.md)


# Project Ideas

Massive disaster of [ideas]({filename}/projects/ideas.md)

I need to figure out a better way to log new ideas. I had hoped that
keeping a markdown page of them in git would help but... nope.


# Python Projects

I've enjoyed working in [Python] more than any other language I've yet
run across. Thus it's unsurprising that I use it whenever there's an
opportunity to do so!

* [koji-smoky-dingo] CLI client plugin for the [koji] build system
* [python-javatools] Utilities for inspecting and diffing Java
  bytecode
* [python-sibilant] LISP dialect that compiles to Python
  bytecode. Currently in stasis while I write a custom bytecode
  interpreter for it.
* [python-mapbind] Left-hand assignment-aware binding wrapper
* [python-promises] Container and transparent proxy promises for
  Python
* [python-brine] Advanced function pickling features for Python
* [python-values] The values type from Sibilant, made generic
* [python-spexy] Ridiculous hack, LISP-like preprocessor for
  Python. This is what inspired me to work on Sibilant.

# Old Stuff

Interests change as time goes by, and sometimes you can't keep a
project alive once it's no longer being used.


## Bukkit Plugins

I've put together a number of [Bukkit] plugins that we used to employ
on our server, which has been offline for years now.

* [bukkit-utils] Utility classes used by the rest of my plugins
* [bukkit-worlds] Simplified plugin for providing multi-world loading
* [bukkit-dispenser] Adds features to the Dispenser block. For the
  most part this is now obsolete, as many of these functions made it
  into minecraft-proper.
* [bukkit-places] Adds locations, graveyards, and home and visit commands
* [bukkit-weather] Adds weather control, with per-world configuration
* [bukkit-warp] Makes nether portals into flexible teleporters
* [bukkit-want] Adds convenient names and aliases for giving items to
  players, including packs of multiple items.

## Warcraft Addons

Some ultra-tiny addons for World of Warcraft, ~~distributed here for
friends~~, not hosted elsewhere. TODO: store these somewhere and maybe
revive them one day.

* [Whose Aura Is This?][whoseaura] - adds caster names to the
  buff/debuff tooltip
* [Remove Blizzard Frames][removeframes] - removes the default
  Blizzard raid frames and boss frames

## Misc Old Projects

* [Pidgin] - I used to contribute to the Pidgin project, specifically
  in the arena of Sametime support.
* [Meanwhile] - This was the library for communicating with a Sametime
  server. Reverse engineered from packet captures. Good times, but
  alas I no longer have to use Sametime, so I no longer am driven to
  keep this up-to-date.
* [JaMUD] - Back in 2000 I used to hack at writing a MUD server. It
  never got very far, but it was entertaining.

# Changelog

2023-10-15
: removed mentions of Google Code, which has been dead and burried for
  quite some time. Need to figure out what to do with the old WoW
  addons, since they aren't currently in git.
