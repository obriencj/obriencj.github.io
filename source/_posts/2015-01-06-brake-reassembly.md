The new seal kit and the replacement brake pistons arrived! I had
spent some of last night cleaning the caliper as best I could.

<!-- more -->

I initially attacked it inside and out with WD-40 and a soft brass
brush. This would be an *awful* idea if I had not followed that up
with a wipe down and then a second cleaning pass with CRC
Brakleen. The residue that WD-40 leaves behind is a good protective
cover for things that are left in the open air, but it's just another
bad contaminent on the insides of a caliper. However, it's cheap and
does a really great job as a "first pass" for getting rust, grit,
gunk, and grime broken up and out of the way. The Brakleen pass then
gets rid of any leftovers contaminents, and removes the WD-40's
residual lubrication. The result is a pair of brake cylinders that are
clean and dry and ready for their new seals and pistons.

On a side note, I use WD-40 on the chain of my TU250x in a similar
fashion -- as an initial cleaning pass. It's inexpensive, readily
available, and gets grime out of the way. I always follow that up with
a wipe-down and an application of a proper teflon-based chain
lubricant though.
