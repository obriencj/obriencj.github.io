The new seal kit and the replacement brake pistons arrived! I had
spent some of last night cleaning the caliper as best I could.

## Cleaning

I initially attacked it inside and out with WD-40 and a soft brass
brush. This would be an *awful* idea if I had not followed that up
with a wipe down and then a second cleaning pass with CRC
Brakleen. The residue that WD-40 leaves behind is a good protective
cover for things that are left in the open air, but it's just another
bad contaminant on the insides of a caliper. However, it's cheap and
does a really great job as a "first pass" for getting rust, grit,
gunk, and grime broken up and out of the way. The Brakleen pass then
gets rid of any leftovers contaminants, and removes the WD-40's
residual lubrication. The result is a pair of brake cylinders that are
clean and dry and ready for their new seals and pistons.

On a side note, I use WD-40 on the chain of my TU250x in a similar
fashion -- as an initial cleaning pass. It's inexpensive, readily
available, and gets grime out of the way. I always follow that up with
a wipe-down and an application of a proper Teflon-based chain
lubricant though.

## Rebuild

I installed the new seals, and took special care to ensure that the
inner seal was right-side-up. There's a very fine lip that needs to be
towards the inside of the brake cylinder, else when under pressure the
brake fluid will force its way out past the piston. The dust seal
isn't as finicky.

Then it was just a matter of wetting the new pistons in clean brake
fluid and pressing them carefully into their cylinders, taking care
not to damage the seals on the way in. I closed up the drain screws on
the caliper, and attached the new brake line.

## Todo

I'll remove the existing controls from the drag bars and move them all
over to the new EMGO bars in the near future, and from there I'll be
in position to fill the and bleed the brake line and see whether
things have improved. I'm pretty darn certain that they will have.

It seems that we live in a new golden age for the hobbyist
mechanic. YouTube has been invaluable in providing education regarding
the function and repair of the brakes, and Amazon and eBay have been
an extraordinary resource in obtaining replacement parts. A person
need only be possessed of the appropriate will, some basic tools, and
an internet connection, and they can repair a wide variety of
mechanisms with confidence.
