My motorcycle is in the shop this morning. I ride a little [TU250x]
that I call "Tux". I bought her for myself as a birthday present last
year, and have put a little over 6000 miles on her since. She's a good
bike, and I take a lot of pleasure in our rides together. I perform
the majority of her maintenance myself -- oil, chain, valves,
electrical. But one thing I didn't want to do was replace and balance
the tires, so I'm paying the guys at [Team Powersports] to do it.

While Tux is off getting new tires, my daughter and I are sitting on
the back porch. She has been reading [Rurouni Kenshin] for the first
time, and I have been working on the documentation for
[python-promises].

I recently discovered, much to my surprise, that promises has a
user. Possibly more than one. This is crazy to me because of all my
projects promises has the most direct competition. It's also one I
decided not to publish on [PyPI] (for the very reason of the
previously mentioned competing modules). It would appear that indeed
the very act of publishing code publicly will draw *someone* to use
it. I had maintained doubt about this rule, but I will have to take
this new anecdote in stride.

Oh dear. I hope that doesn't mean [Spexy] has users...

This new-found user has turned out to be very useful. They've already
[provided][issue1] excellent and insightful feedback, which in turn
has blossomed into new features. I can only hope that my other
projects will over time gather attention of similar quality.

Perhaps I'll rethink promises a bit more. After I give it a good hard
look I'll reconsider if maybe -- just maybe -- I ought to publish it
to PyPI after all.
