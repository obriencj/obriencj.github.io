I was seeking to clean out `~/devel` today, and I found *something*.
Something I'd forgotten. Something that is so bizarre I'm not even
sure what I was thinking when I hacked at it. Something I had to
double check that I'd actually written, because it was so foreign to
me.

<!-- more -->

Then I noticed the date. Ah 2007, the Ambien era. When Space Lord
Zolpidem guided me on battles through the multiverse on a nightly
basis. I don't remember a whole lot from 2007. Wish I could say the
same for 2008, but I digress.

At some point in our adventures, SLZ and I apparently hacked together
a LISP/Scheme-like python file encoding -- "spexy".

_Keep in mind, this isn't a scheme interpreter written in Python._ No
no no, this decodes to Python. I think I'm going to try and clean this
up and see how much sense it can be made to make.

And then you can bet your ass I'm going to pollute GitHub with it.

Stay off drugs, kids.
