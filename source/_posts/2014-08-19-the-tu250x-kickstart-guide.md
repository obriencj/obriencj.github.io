I've finally written up and vastly expanded upon the information I
originally had been posting in the "[Kickstart for the TU?][thread]"
thread on [tu250riders.com][forum]. It almost certainly will go
through a few more revisions, but it's in a state now where it may
actually make sense to other people!

So check out my
[TU250x Kickstart](/projects/motorcycle/tu250x-kickstart/) page, which
details the changes needed, the part numbers, and the work required to
make it happen!

*edit*: I've rewritten bits of the guide to make more sense, and I've
added Amazon.com links to a number of the tools or consumable items
that are required to get the job done.
