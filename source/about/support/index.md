## The Electronic Frontier Foundation

Like so many others I rely heavily on the [freedom] of an open internet
to express myself, to pursue my interests, and to earn a living. To
these ends I support the [Electronic Frontier Foundation].

If you are interested in keeping the internet free (and you darned
well ought to be), I entreat you to [donate to the EFF]. Get yourself
some cool stickers!
