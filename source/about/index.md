My name is Christopher O'Brien, but I typically go by the monicker
'siege.' The story behind this nickname is significantly less
interesting than you might imagine.

I am the proud father of a beautiful little girl named Zoe. She loves
riding her bike and playing Minecraft, and she is the light of my
life.

I work at ridiculous projects in the wee hours of the night.
Frequently things that nobody would (nor should) actually use.
However, I do not view this time as wasted. These mad hacks are a
creative exercise, and I find that my re-inventions can provide
excellent insight into otherwise inobvious situations.

I work for [Red Hat] in the role of a Release Engineer, wherein I get
to apply the saner aspects of my programming skills to the domain of
building and releasing software.

## Social

Of course I've got profiles on the common social sites. These will
most likely not be interesting to strangers.
