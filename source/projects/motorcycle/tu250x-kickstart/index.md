## About the Suzuki TU250x

[{% img right https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qGJxKz9OrLE/U_O03dorEzI/AAAAAAAAQXE/RDNooywvohk/s400/DSC00132.JPG 400 300 My TU250x, "tux" %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mr5UEDcdjgIvcdwXa09C5490Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
The [Suzuki TU250x] is a 249cc EFI [UJM], produced in Japan and
imported for sale in the United States from 2009 to 2015. The
bi-yearly updates of the US version have thus far been limited to
trimline changes.

[Suzuki TU250x]: http://www.suzukicycles.com/Product%20Lines/Cycles/Products/TU250X/2013/TU250X.aspx

[UJM]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Japanese_motorcycle

Outside of the US, the bike has a wider audience and has been
available longer; originally as a carburated, 4-valve format with more
varients and options. The closest direct kin to the modern TU250X in
the Japanese market is the ST250.

The ST250 was available in a standard model and an "E-Type" model. The
E-Type is the fancier version, with a two-tone trimline, and prior to
2008 a kickstarter and a decompression lever on the cylinder head
cover. The kickstart feature was dropped from the E-Type line in 2008,
along with a switch to fuel injection. Interestingly, the 2008 E-Type
appears to be the basis for the 2009 TU250X (ie: the "fast red one").

I will use the following conventions when referring to models for the
rest of this document:

SP250
: 1982 or 1983 SP250 dual sport, carburated 4 valve, with kickstart

ST250
: 2004 or later ST250, carburated 4 valve, no kickstart

ST250XK4
: 2004 through 2007 ST250 E-Type, carburated 4 valve, with
kickstart

ST250XK8
: 2008 or later ST250 E-Type, EFI 2 valve, no kickstart

TU250X
: 2009 or later TU250x, EFI 2 valve, no kickstart

## What's Missing for the Kickstart

The omission of the kickstart feature on the TU250X is accomplished
partly by the expedient of simply not including the parts, and by
plugging up the hole in the clutch cover. However, there is one
important piece which is altered rather than left out: the drive
shaft.

On the ST250XK4, the drive shaft has an elongated tail which projects
out of the crank case. It is onto this nub that the idler gear would
be set. On the TU250X, ST250, and ST250XK8 the shaft is too short to
mount the gear (though oddly it retains a groove for the retaining
clip).

[{% img right https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aQUgBJFKUYo/U-ED4ZS6eFI/AAAAAAAAQJQ/JbZq09IWNFg/s400/DSC00104.JPG 400 300 Original TU250X drive shaft (top), ST250XK4 (middle), SP250 (bottom) %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/q2aAk1HCEVCOYQI9xLCnXI90Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
For reference here is the original TU250X drive shaft (top), the
ST250XK4 (middle), and the SP250 (bottom). Note that the older SP250
shaft does include the longer tail end to support the idler gear, but
that the sprocket end is shorter (possibly due to the SP250's narrower
frame).


## Getting Kickstart Parts

[{% img right https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w1OpUyias3c/U9-1H7YPhDI/AAAAAAAAQIY/E9sJpv37D9o/s400/IMG_2816.JPG 400 300 Parts waiting to be installed %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GP8b38orKfEidb3ih70qOo90Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
The internal pieces of the actual kickstart assembly are identical to
those from an older incarnation of the this family of engine: the
SP250. These assemblies can frequently be [found on eBay][ks-ebay] for
under $50 USD, although the completeness of parts can be hit or miss.

[ks-ebay]: http://search.ebay.com/SP250+kick+start__W0QQsacat6028

The idler gear (and its washer and circlip) can sometimes be had on
eBay as well (even as part of an auction for the kickstart assembly
mentioned above). Note that this gear is categorized as part of the
transmission assembly in any of the Suzuki part list breakdowns.

The elongated driveshaft which is necessary for mounting the idler
gear does not appear in any prior models available in the US.

You will need to find a new oil seal and the correct kickstart
lever. The oil seal is available in the US, but the lever is not.

Note that the 1983 SP250's lever sweeps in a different arc than the
ST250's, which will very likely be an issue as the folded lever fits
close to the motorcycle's frame. It would most probably would strike
the frame or pegs, but I have not physically verified this.

I had a good experience in obtaining the Japan-only parts from
[Samurider.com], and I highly recommend going to them first. Simply
give them the part numbers referenced above and they will email you
with a quote.

[samurider.com]: http://www.samurider.com/?page_id=117

A complete list of parts is included in the
[Required Parts](#required-parts) section below.


## What's Missing for the Decomp

The decompression lever is part of the cylinder head assembly,
specifically on the cylinder head cover. Apart from the small shaft
and return spring of the decomp itself, there is a small hole that
would be bored through the cover. On the non-E-type models, this hole
is not present, though it is obvious where it would be bored out on
the mold.

In order to add a decompression lever, one must acquire:

- decompression assembly
- supporting cylinder head cover (normally only sold as a unit with
  the cylinder head)

I weigh in at roughly 170 lbs with boots and gear and I am able --
without any prior skill in the matter -- to kick start my modified
TU250X without the assistance of a decompression lever. At this time I
have not sought out the necessary parts to add this feature. I may
consider doing so in the future just for the sake of completeness.
When/If that happens, I will update this guide to include the
additional steps.


## Prerequisites

Before you even consider this modification, make sure you have the
time, space, and tools to bring it to completion. I was able to keep
the engine work constrained to a 3' x 5' table, with tools on a nearby
bench. Any smaller workspace may prove problematic.

In the tools and consumables sections that follow I include an
associate link to Amazon where applicable. If you can find the tool
cheaper elsewhere, that's great! If you want to buy it from Amazon
though, please use these links. It won't cost you more, but I'll get a
penny in my tip jar for having referred you.

[{% img right https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J3XlYj4ZvbI/U_OlzxnkQeI/AAAAAAAAQVU/gTCHxhL1fwU/s400/DSC00115.JPG 400 300 Manuel, relay instructions %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hdiGnXv1VstAfb4W7UGMjo90Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
You will require a copy of the [TU250X Service Manual][Manual], which
has step-by-step disassembly and re-assembly instructions, as well as
the correct torque values for all bolts and screws. I recommend
reading the engine disassembly and reassembly sections multiple times
in advance, so that you have a clear idea of what you'll be doing well
before starting the work. Even afterwards, keep it nearby as it's best
to double check your work against it as you progress.

### Required Tools

Rear stand
: For rear wheel removal, and as an aide in keeping the bike steady.

Pneumatic jack
: To aide in engine removal and replacement. I didn't use a jack
  specific to motorcycles, so I needed to use a piece of wood to
  provide a relatively soft, flat surface between the jack and engine.

Torque wrench
: It will need to be adjustable to at least 100 N/m for this project.

Breaker bar
: A lot of tough bolts, you'll need the leverage.

Impact driver
: In order to remove the four shift mechanism screws, which have
  threadlock holding them in place.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NYDRG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002NYDRG&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=LZYHQQRHXJERGEPZ">Lisle 29200 3/8" Hand Impact Tool Set</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0002NYDRG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Case splitter
: This will pull the case halves apart. It functions by bolting into
  the right side of the case and then applying a lot of pressure onto
  the crank shaft.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039L9PSU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0039L9PSU&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=PDDNX7DVDIB5K2A7">Tusk Crankcase Splitter/Separator</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0039L9PSU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Clutch holder
: Acts as a handle so you can hold the primary driven assembly in
  place.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039LEZFS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0039LEZFS&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=L7DGPB6IBBOGJKQM">Tusk Clutch Holding Tool</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0039LEZFS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Metric sockets
: 8mm, 9mm, 10mm, 12mm, 14mm, 17mm, 19mm, 24mm, 30mm

Alan drivers
: You'll want actual socket drivers in order to get enough leverage to
remove the cam sprocket bolts, which have threadlock.

Circlip Pliers
: The transmission, kickstart assembly, and oil pump all use circlips
 to retain their gears.


### Optional Tools

Slide hammer/bearing puller
: I personally found one bearing that needed to be replaced. Removing
  a bearing without a slide hammer and blind bearing puller approaches
  impossible. You may not need this, if all your bearings spin freely.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1RXHKQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00G1RXHKQ&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=OHZTKFOQRS3UCXLB">9pc Blind Hole Slide Hammer Pilot Bearing Internal External Remover Puller Set</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00G1RXHKQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Rotor holder
: This is a specialty Suzuki tool specific for this task, but it's
  possible to get around using it as the rotor bolt has significantly
  more torque on it than many of the other bolts you'll be dealing
  with

Bar clamps
: Good for temporarily holding the case halves together when you are
  in the process of digging out the baggie of case bolts. Four small
  ones is enough.

Brass brush
: For cleaning mating surfaces and removing gasket bits. Brass is soft
  enough to not mar the aluminium of the engine. Do not use steel.

Platic razor/scraper
: For cutting away the side cover gaskets that inevitably adhere
  themselves to the covers. Do not use regular razor blades, you run a
  high risk of damaging mating surfaces and causing an oil leak.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086X6SIQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0086X6SIQ&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=MBU27HFBO347QD42">Neiko 4-Piece Composite Scraper Set</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0086X6SIQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Leather work gloves
: The machined surfaces of the case are often sharp, and while you are
  trying to pull the case halves apart it is easy to slice yourself.

Neoprene gloves
: Makes cleaning up for the night a lot easier. Especially useful if
  you'll be doing the work in short spurts.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XXO60M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002XXO60M&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=CTCDKBYB6V5ZL3Z3">SAS Safety 66518 Raven Powder-Free Disposable Black Nitrile 6 Mil Gloves, Large, 100 Gloves by Weight</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002XXO60M" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />


### Required Consumables

Assembly lube
: Any part that touches metal needs assembly lube. This stuff adheres
  like a gel, but will dissolve in the engine oil once everything is
  back together again. Lube liberally.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M8RYUE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000M8RYUE&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=IPEYCRJFVVZHSFS6">CRC SL3331 Extreme Pressure Engine Assembly Lube, 10 Wt Oz</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000M8RYUE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Liquid gasket 1512
: The case halves are machined to have a very tight mating
  surface. Liquid gasket is applied in a very thin bead along the
  specified surfaces (see your Service Guide) immediately prior to
  joining the case back together.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D3QUU8U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00D3QUU8U&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=APYKB2TUW7WBG4SZ">THREE BOND GASKET MAKER GRAY 8.8 OZ TB1215</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00D3QUU8U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Lithium grease
: Oil seals and frame bearings will want clean grease. - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BGSE2CW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BGSE2CW&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=SB3B5NREWRCLNMMB">Liquid Wrench GR014 White Lithium Grease - 8 oz.</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00BGSE2CW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Thread lock
: Required for the reassembly process, you really don't want your cam
  nuts coming undone.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UKMBES/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000UKMBES&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=6PUIOK35FYYVATU2">THREE BOND INT'L, INC.

Gasket set
: You'll need to replace the gaskets for the clutch cover, generator
  cover, cylinder, and cylinder head during the tear-down and rebuild
  process. See previous section for part numbers.


### Optional Consumables

WD-40
: For cleaning components prior to re-lubbing them

Gasket remover
: Wasting time on tough gasket remnants sucks, just
  spray this on them and peel them off like a potato skin with the
  platic razor.  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M8IE6W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000M8IE6W&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=J6S3JWLIKSMVFTJO">CRC 05021 Technician Grade Gasket Remover - 12 Wt Oz.</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000M8IE6W" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Gallon baggies
: Put every assembly and various groups of screws in their own bags

Shop towels
: There will be a lot of oil, grease, and general chemical gunk,
  you're going to want something stronger than the paper towels in
  your kitchen. Get the blue disposable shop towels.

Oven cleaner
: I found that my cylinder head was encrusted with carbon deposits, as
  was my piston head. Oven cleaner, a brass brush, and a lot of elbow
  grease will help to remove it.


## Remove the engine

To begin with, you'll be removing the easily accessible parts.  Remove
the side covers, seats, and gas tank. Remove the front sprocket.
Remove the muffler, the oxygen sensor, and the exhaust header. Remove
the starter motor. Remove the PAIR valve. Disconnect the throttle body
from the cylinder head.

Unplug the generator, neutral detector, and temperature sensor
cables. Disentangle those generator and neutral wires from the frame;
they will be coming out with the engine and you don't want them
catching on anything while you're focused on getting the engine out of
the frame itself.

Drain the engine of its oil. Remove the oil pan and the shift detente
from the bottom of the engine. This should give you a nice flat base
to deal with, free from bolts.

Set the bike up on the rear stand. Note, I do this after all the
easily accessible bits prior, especially the muffler -- my rearstand
bumps into it, unnecessarily complicating things.

Remove the rear wheel. Set aside the rear axle bolt.

Set the pneumatic jack beneath the engine (use a flat of wood to
protect the engine) and raise it to be firmly against the bottom,
without accidentally knocking your bike off the rearstand.

Remove the five top and front mounting bolts, and the small bolt
hiding underneath the swingarm frame bolt.

Remove the nut from the swingarm bolt, and use the rear axle bolt
(which is conveniently the same size) to begin pushing the swingarm
bolt out. This part is tricky. You want to get to the point where both
bolts are holding one side of the swingarm to the frame, but where
neither are preventing the engine from coming out.

Slowly, and very carefully, move the engine forward out of the frame
and downward. This will take a lot of finesse and fidgeting, do not
rush it and try not to lose your temper or your grip on the
precariously balanced engine. More than any other aspect, this
activity benefits from an assistant.

[{% img right https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XD4a1Lebuvg/U9-1GpdX8rI/AAAAAAAAQII/_u3Ups5NFOA/s400/IMG_2838.JPG 400 300 I never did get into yoga %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0N7z0AulW8uOVf1qNPTOBI90Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
If all goes well, you can now lug around the 70 lbs of filthy and
unweidly engine to your workspace. Again, I recommend at least a 3' by
5' table to perform this work on, and optionally some sort of durable
tablecloth or pad to deal with the mess. I, for example, finally got
some use out of a yoga mat I've had sitting around.


## Disassemble According to Service Manual

There are a number of steps in the service manual that are geared more
towards a full teardown. Since we are only interested in getting into
the crank case, you can skip the removal of the generator rotor,
removal of the pison, and removal of the crank shaft. You can also
skip a full teardown of the cylinder head cover or removal of the
valves.

Everything on the clutch-cover side of the engine must be removed,
since that's the side of the crank case that you'll be sliding off and
attaching the kickstart assembly to. Take special care with the
mechanism of the gear shift assembly. Once freed of the gear selector
drum, the spring-loaded pawls will eject themselves. Be prepared to
grab and baggie them for later. Double check that you have both pawls,
both pins, and both springs in the set.

When separating the case halves with the case splitting tool, remember
that the case needs to come off straight or not at all. In my
particular situation, the counter-balance shaft was very tight in its
bearing, and came up with the case rather than falling out. This meant
that the counter-balance weight itself had to be maneuvered around the
crank. Be very patient.

After separating, you'll need to clean off the old gasket
material. The case gasket is a rubber substance which comes off easily
with the sharp plastic scrapers. Take care that gasket remnants do not
fall into the engine bearings, etc. You don't want tiny bits of rubber
interfering with your engine after you've got everything re-assembled.


## Replace driveshaft

Pull the rails out of the gearshift forks, and then remove the
gearshift drum. This should free up the countershaft and driveshaft of
the transmission for removal. They will come out exactly straight and
as a pair or not at all. You may find it helps to tap the driveshaft's
sprocket mount with a rubber mallet to get things moving. Once again,
the keyword here is patience.

This is a good time to verify that all of your bearings are turning
freely. They should spin easily with just a light flick of your
fingertip. In my case, I found that the countershaft bearing on the
left case half (where the clutch actuator flipper sits) was resistant
to turning, so had to pull and replace it. You'll need a slide hammer
and blind bearing puller in this case -- see the optional tools
section above.

At this point you can disassemble the driveshaft portion of the
transmission. Smear assembly lube onto the longer ST250XK4 driveshaft,
and assemble the original gears onto it. Pay careful attention to the
orientation of your gears and the width of the washers. Refer to your
service manual to double-check.


## Install Kickstart Shaft

The kickstart shaft mounts through the right side of the crank case,
just above the hole for the shift lever rod.

Grease the kickstart shaft, and install smaller sliding gear onto the
shaft. Take care to line up the small dots that are impressed upon the
shaft and the gear. Follow them with the tension spring and its large
washer. The shaft can then be slid through the case where we will
continue on the other side. Note that in this picture the gear guide
and stopper are already installed -- I found it easier to install
those parts after the next step.

From the inside face of the right crank case, attach the return spring
to the case and through the hole in the kickstart shaft. Set the
spring guide into the spring with the angular end facing out. If the
curved end is left facing out, the spring may escape the guide.
Install the circlip to retain the guide. At this point, there should
not be any tension on the return spring.

Temporarily attach the kickstart lever onto the kickstart shaft,
pointing towards roughly 3 o'clock. With your left hand, rotate the
shaft counter clock wise, which will put tension onto the return
spring and rotating the sliding gear's guide into its correct "home"
position. At this point, hold the lever in place and attach the
stopper and guide plates by bolting it to the crank case. You can then
slowly relax your hold on the lever, allowing the sliding gear to meet
the guide plate and stop itself against the stopper plate.

I found this method to be significantly easier to manage than
attaching the guide and stopper plates first and attempting to put a
quarter turn onto the return spring with pliers before installing the
return spring guide. I hope that it saves you some frustration as
well.

Verify that the shaft rotates cleanly, with the sliding gear moving
into and out of an engaged position and with the shaft returning and
stopping at the home position. If everything works, remove one of the
plate bolts, apply a drop of 1333 thread lock, and replace it. Then
repeat with the other bolt.


## Close Up the Crank Case

You can now re-assemble the crank-case contents as per the service
manual. If you find that some of the shafts are very tight, I
recommend bagging the assembly in question and sticking it in the
freezer for a few hours. This will cause a minute amount of metal
shringkage, which is often just enough to make the shafts not bind
when you attempt re-assembly. As I'd mentioned earlier, the
counter-balance was a tough fit when warm, but when cold I was able to
get the case halves together without an issue. This is important,
because you only have so much time to fiddle with getting the halves
back together again after you've applied the liquid gasket.

Double check that everything is in place, that everything rotates as
it should, that the crank and counter-balancer dots line up.

Apply a thin and even bead of liquid gasket to the surfaces indicated
in the service manual and carefully join your case halves
together. Once again, it goes on straight or not at all. As soon as
you have the case surfaces mated, clamp them tightly together and start
replacing all thirteen case bolts.

The case bolts are a variety of lengths. An easy rule of thumb to
determine that you're using the right length bolt in a particular hole
is to simply check that it has a between 1 and 2 cm sticking out if
you insert it without turning. If you can insert it flush, it's
obviously too short of a bolt; if it only slides in a bit and leaves
more than 2cm sticking out, then it's too long.


## Install Idler and Complete Kickstart

While your seal is setting up, you can install that idler gear onto
the newly elongated nub of your drive shaft. Lube up and slide on the
gear, the spacer, and attach the circlip. Check that it spins freely
and doesn't wobble.

Moving on to the kickstart shaft, you can now install a circlip and
washer, then the larger part of the kickstart gear pair. It should
mesh with the idler. Another washer then a final circlip to hold it in
place.

[{% img right https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qFm5fIP1_RE/U-bTuD3ruVI/AAAAAAAAQRI/4pW-mM-4RlM/s400/DSC00107.JPG 400 300 The kickstart gearing and the idler %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/uB3PCxyKzsWEiwHgYbDJgI90Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
The idler and kickstart gear should spin freely, without encountering
the ratcheting teeth of the sliding kickstart gear that is held away
by the guide plate. When the kickstart shaft is turned counter clock
wise, the sliding gear will leave the guide plate and will slide out
to engage with the teeth of the kickstart gear, in turn driving the
idler.

Now is a good time to take a flat-faced drift or old screwdriver and
knock the kickstart plug out of the clutch-cover and replace it with
the proper oil seal. The plug is in there pretty well, so smack it
firmly from the inside of the case, dead center on the plug
itself. Take care not to accidentally gouge your cover. Once the plug
pops out, the oil seal can be placed with only finger pressure and
some patience. The opening through which you can see the tensioning
spring should face into the engine, not out. Make sure it fully
seated, and lube it up with some lithium grease.


## Put It All Back Where You Found It

[{% img right https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BYUj-zbgVIY/U-bTiURa1qI/AAAAAAAAQRM/o7STp0zRpGQ/s400/DSC00109.JPG 400 300 Just the covers and I'm all set %}](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OgIWZoqqVKWHHBVugmHDwo90Bmq-8q5KVhdpQ6O0Fv4?feat=embedwebsite)
If this all goes smoothly, then you're in the clear to complete the
re-assembly process. Follow the service guide, and everything should
fit together. Make sure all your mating surfaces are clean before
placing new gaskets. I had a real bastard of a time removing the old
clutch cover gasket chunks, and it took a lot of CRC gasket remover
and elbow grease with a plastic razor before I could call it
ready. But all that work sure beats having an oil leak later.

Remount the engine by lifting it slowly with the pneumatic jack, and
turning and guiding it into place. I focused first on getting the
swingarm mounts lined up, and drove home that bolt before trying to
line up any others.

After the engine is secure, it's time to reconnect the cables,
resinstall the rear wheel, the chain, the front-sprocket, and
everything else you removed in the first place.

If you wanted to remove your PAIR valve, this is the perfect
opportunity, but I'll provide more details on that in a later post.

Put in a new oil filter, replace the shift neutral stopper, oil pan,
and drain plug, and fill her up with clean oil. Double check all of
your mounting bolts and available case bolts for their proper
torque. Check that while you were doing this, no oil has been pouring
out of the engine.

Slide on the kickstart lever, and bolt it securely in place.


## Start That TU

Look over everything once more. What did you forget? I always forget
something, and this is the time to remember it!

Try the electric start first, and [holler like a madman][itsalive]
when it fires up. Calm your neighbors, reassuring them that you aren't
hurt, you're just very happy. Shut off the engine, and attempt to kick
your TU into life!

[It may take you a while to get the hang of it][kickvideo], but don't
be discouraged. The fuel pump will sporadically start whenever you
turn the engine even slightly, just ignore it and give the lever a
good strong kick back and down. I find it helps to grab the rear brake
lever along with the clutch, and push back on the bars a bit. After a
weekend of riding, you'll get the feel for it!
