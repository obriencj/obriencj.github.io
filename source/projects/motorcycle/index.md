I currently own two motorcycles. I most frequently ride a fantastic
piece of Japanese machinery, the Suzuki TU250x. I've recently picked
up a beater/project bike, a 1984 Honda VT500FT. It's in rough
condition, but it was inexpensive and I think it will be a lot of fun
to fix.


## 2013 Suzuki TU250x, Tux

Fuel injected, SOHC, air-cooled -- 249cc of pure joy.  Mine came from
[Team Powersports in Raleigh][tps]. I've made a few modifications so
far, but apart from the possibility of a custom seat soem day I think
I'm about done changing her up.

* de-stickered
* added tank knee pads
* intake snorkel removed
* second-hand, black flyscreen from Dart
* [Kyle Racing bar-end weights](http://www.shop.kyleusa.com/product.sc?productId=629&categoryId=58) and generic bar-end mirrors
* [OEM fork gaiters](http://japan.webike.net/products/1566192.html)
* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVS6H2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001AVS6H2&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=K6LGILBZWIVUP2RE">16T Front Sprocket</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001AVS6H2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
* Shinko 712 tires <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD8W68/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001CD8W68&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=XQGQJPYZMHPVUZFW">Front - 100/90-18</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001CD8W68" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005242JDA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005242JDA&linkCode=as2&tag=obrieisapileo-20&linkId=DVM3KYOM7AXL5AKS">Rear - 120/90-18</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=obrieisapileo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005242JDA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (one size up for both)
* [PAIR valve] removed
* [Kickstart] added (from the Japanese ST250 E-Type)
* [RSY Beauty] exhaust (now painted black)
* Power Commander V

I would love to pick up the classic-styled front and rear fender from
Japan and to get the whole bike painted a nice deep Oxblood and cream
two-tone. Maybe that can be a five-year present?

I'm interested in some of the air and battery relocation jobs I've
seen others do. I admire the minimalist look that results.

A [Frankentux](/projects/motorcycle/frankentux/) might be a fun idea, too.

## 1984 Honda VT500FT, Uggo

I snagged the [Uggo] in December of 2014 after she caught my eye on
craigslist. She's as ugly as the nickname implies, but there's a
certain charm that I find very appealing. She needs so much work, but
that's all of the fun really.

500cc, liquid cooled, v-twin, shaft-driven. Plastic bits that scream
"look at me, I'm from the 80s" and some seriously worn components. I
think she wants to become a cafe bike or perhaps a flat tracker. We
shall have to see.

She came to me as a [hot mess], but now she's [hauling ass].

## 1994 Tomos Targa

This is actually Zoe's bike, not mine. For her birthday in 2015 I
bought her a 49cc two-stroke moped. It needed some love, but was
functional from day one. Zoe loves it, but she's only allowed to take
it on back roads until she's older. So far she claims to have gotten
it up to 31 mph, an impressive feat!


## 1976 Suzuki GT250, Peanut

There's something about two-strokes. I think it's the sound when they
idle, or maybe the smell of that smoke. Whatever it is, I've been
wanting one of my own ever since Zoe has been hauling around on her
Tomos. Fortune lead me to Suzuki's old GT model line, and as luck
would have it, I discovered a listing for a GT250 from 1976. '76 was a
good year for this bike, they got rid of some crazy cooling devices in
favor of more sensible fins on the cylinder, and tweaked the porting
and jet sizes to give it more power.

So in December of 2015, I ended up with Peanut, named thus because of
the whole, unshelled, oily, ancient peanut I scooped out of her front
sprocket compartment along with around 2 lbs of mud and leaves. I am
already in love. She's the size and weight of Tux, so she handles like
a sparrow. While she's admittedly a limp noodle below 4k RPM, from 6k
to 8k she'll happily lift that front wheel. Six speed gearbox and a
twin pair of pipes that sing the ring-ding-ding song of her
people. She only had 6k miles on her when she arrived in my
driveway. I've been hard at work getting her as healthy as I can. She
ran after just a spark regapping, but I want her to be better than I
found her. So new tires, new sprockets, new chain, new clutch pack,
carb rebuild, etc etc.
