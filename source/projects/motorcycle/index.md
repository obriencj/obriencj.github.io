I currently own two motorcycles. I most frequently ride a fantastic
piece of Japanese machinery, the Suzuki TU250x. I've recently picked
up a beater/project bike. A 1984 Honda VT500FT. It's in rough
condition, but it was inexpensive. I think it will be a lot of fun to
fix.


## 2013 Suzuki TU250x, Tux

Fuel injected, SOHC, air-cooled -- 249cc of pure joy.  Mine came from
[Team Powersports in Raleigh][tps]. I've made a few modifications so
far, but apart from the possibility of a custom seat soem day I think
I'm about done changing her up.

* de-stickered
* bar-end mirrors
* [OEM fork gaiters](http://japan.webike.net/products/1566192.html)

* [PAIR valve] removed
* [kickstart] added (from the Japanese ST250 E-Type)
* [RSY Beauty] exhaust

I would love to pick up the classic-styled front and rear fender from
Japan and to get the whole bike painted a nice deep Oxblood and cream
two-tone. Maybe that can be a five-year present?

I'm interested in some of the air and battery relocation jobs I've
seen others do. I admire the minimalist look that results.

A [Frankentux](/projects/motorcycle/frankentux/) might be a fun idea, too.

## 1984 Honda VT500FT, Uggo

I snagged the Uggo after it caught my eye on craigslist. It's as ugly
as the nickname implies, but there's a certain charm that I find very
appealing. She needs so much work, but that's all of the fun really.

500cc, liquid cooled, v-twin, shaft-driven. Plastic bits that scream
"look at me, I'm from the 80s" and some seriously warn components. I
think she wants to become a cafe bike or perhaps a flat tracker. We
shall have to see.

Right now she's a [hot mess].
