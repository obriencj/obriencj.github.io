I ride a fantastic piece of Japanese machinery called the Suzuki
TU250x. Fuel injected, SOHC, air-cooled -- 249cc of pure joy.

Mine came from [Team Powersports in Raleigh][tps], and is a 2013
model. I've only made a few minor modifications so far.

* de-stickered
* bar-end mirrors
* fork gaiters (OEM)
* 16t front sprocket (OEM is 15t)
* Shinko 712 tires (one size up front and back)
* [PAIR valve] removed
* [kick-start] added (from the Japanese ST250 E-Type)

I would love to pick up the classic-styled front and rear fender from
Japan and to get the whole bike painted a nice deep Oxblood and cream
two-tone. Maybe that can be a five-year present?
