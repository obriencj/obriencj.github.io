I work on a number of "mad scientist" projects whenever the fancy
strikes me. I've probably used that idiom incorrectly. I re-invent
things because it's fun. I also find that it's a great way to
viscerally learn why certain approaches are taken; running into the
pitfalls and mistakes on your own then crawling your way back out of
the mess. It gives an excellent perspective.

## Motorcycle Projects

I have a fantastic little motorcycle, let me tell you all about her!

## Project Ideas

Massive disaster of [ideas](/projects/ideas)


## Python Projects

I've enjoyed working in [Python] more than any other language I've yet
run across. Thus it's unsurprising that I use it whenever there's an
opportunity to do so!

* [python-javatools] Utilities for inspecting and diffing Java
  bytecode, written in Python
* [python-promises] Container and transparent proxy promises for
  Python
* [python-brine] Advanced function pickling features for Python
* [python-spexy] Ridiculous hack, LISP-like preprocessor for Python
* [python-sibilant] LISP dialect that compiles to Python bytecode

## Bukkit Plugins

I've put together a number of [Bukkit] plugins that we used to employ
on the [minecraft.preoccupied.net][mc.p.n] (which is currently offline).

* [bukkit-utils] Utility classes used by the rest of my plugins
* [bukkit-worlds] Simplified plugin for providing multi-world loading
* [bukkit-dispenser] Adds features to the Dispenser block. For the
  most part this is now obsolete, as many of these functions made it
  into minecraft-proper.
* [bukkit-places] Adds locations, graveyards, and home and visit commands
* [bukkit-weather] Adds weather control, with per-world configuration
* [bukkit-warp] Makes nether portals into flexible teleporters
* [bukkit-want] Adds convenient names and aliases for giving items to
  players, including packs of multiple items.

## Warcraft Addons

Some ultra-tiny addons for World of Warcraft, distributed here for
friends, not hosted elsewhere.

* [Whose Aura Is This?][whoseaura] - adds caster names to the
  buff/debuff tooltip
* [Remove Blizzard Frames][removeframes] - removes the default
  Blizzard raid frames and boss frames

## Old Stuff

Interests change as time goes by.

* [Pidgin] - I used to contribute to the Pidgin project, specifically
  in the arena of Sametime support.
* [Meanwhile] - This was the library for communicating with a Sametime
  server. Reverse engineered from packet captures. Good times, but
  alas I no longer have to use Sametime, so I no longer am driven to
  keep this up-to-date.
* [JaMUD] - Back in 2000 I used to hack at writing a MUD server. It
  never got very far, but it was entertaining.
